    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This chicken chili has few ingredients with lots of flavor. If you are looking for something quick and healthy,
        this is the recipe to use. This is wonderful over white or brown rice. Top with reduced-fat cheese and/or sour
        cream--I do both!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>

        <li>
            1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon chili powder, or more to taste
        </li>

            2 (16 ounce) cans cannellini beans, divided
        </li>
        <li>
            2 cups chicken stock
        </li>
        <li>
            12 ounces cubed cooked chicken
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine onion and celery in a pot over medium heat. Cook about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until
            vegetables are tender, about 2 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Add green chiles, then chili
            powder and 1 can cannellini beans. Cook until flavors marry, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, pour remaining can of beans into a bowl and mash to a paste consistency. Add mashed beans to the
            onion and bean mixture. Add chicken stock and cooked chicken. Reduce heat and simmer about 25 minutes.
